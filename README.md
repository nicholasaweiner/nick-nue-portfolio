# Nick's Nue Portfolio

I just started to learn Vue.JS, Tailwind CSS, Nuxt.JS and other tools so I used a template portfolio created by [realstoman](https://github.com/realstoman) to get started on the journey. I'm hoping to continue to update and customize this.

## Nuxt.js & TailwindCSS Portfolio

- [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) with [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS v2](https://tailwindcss.com)
